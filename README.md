# Keyboard shortcuts to modify forground colors in Photoshop #

## Installation ##

* Copy the files/folders from `/Presets` to your photoshop Presets folder:
(e.g. `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2018\Presets`). 
Replace everything when prompted. Don't worry though, nothing is getting replaced, just merged with new files.

* Restart Photoshop

* Go to `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts` and change the "Set" (near top right corner) from "Default" to "color mod keys"

Now you can use CTRL+ALT Q A W S E D to modify your foreground color

| HOTKEY | Effect |
|---|---|
| CTRL + ALT + Q | Rotate Hue Right |
| CTRL + ALT + A | Rotate Hue Left |
| CTRL + ALT + W | Increase Brightness 10%|
| CTRL + ALT + S | Decrease Brightness 10%|
| CTRL + ALT + E | Increase Saturation 10%|
| CTRL + ALT + D | Decrease Saturation 10%|

Note: CTRL+ALT is a bit unwieldy but necessary unfortunately because photoshop insists on using CTRL for menu hotkeys, but I added ALT so things like CTRL A and CTRL S don't get replaced.

Much improvement is desired but this is a useable hack for now.
